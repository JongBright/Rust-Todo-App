This is a simple CLI todo app I made to get familiar with Rust.

it works like so:

get --> Prints the todo list to the command line.
add \"Some Text\" --> Add a new todo item.
delete <int> --> Delete the todo with the index <int>.
check <int> --> Check the todo with the index <int>.
uncheck <int> --> Uncheck the todo with the index <int>.
edit <int> \"Some Text\" --> Change the text of the todo with the index <int>.
help --> Prints this message.
